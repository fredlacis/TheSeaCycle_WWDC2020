# The Sea Cycle

 Do you remember those AMAZING products that you bought? Some of them had microplastics in its composition, which certainly will go through your drain and eventually get to the oceans. Some countries are already aware of this big issue and have forbidden the microbeads, but it is still a reality.
 
 Even the products that doesn't have plastic inside, may have plastic outside, in its package, which can be eventually shredded and again go to the ocean.

 If any kind of plastic get to the ocean, you can have it on your dinner table anytime. Even in small quantities it can be deadly in the long run.

 The goal of this playground is not to ask you to stop consuming plastic, but to be conscious about it. Know exactly where you are going to throw it away, and if possible recycle it. The enviroment thanks.
