 # Welcome to the Drugstore ðŸ’Š

 Here is were you can get all of your everyday self-care products.
 But most of the times we don't actually know what is inside them,
 before choosing what you will get, **try clicking some products to
 learn a bit more about them**.

   * Callout(Microplastics ðŸ“Œ):
   This are very small pieces of plastic, witch are very harmfull
   to the enviroment. Most microplastics are fragments of bigger plastic
   stuff, like packages. **Microbeads**, in the other hand, are a type of plastic
   especifically made to be small, and are very common on self-care
   products arround the world.
 
 - Important:
 Put the items that you want inside the shoppingCart array bellow,
 remember to separate them using "**,**".
